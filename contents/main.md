### Welcome to the preview of the next iteration of JSHint.

The project originally started as an effort to make a more configurable
version of JSLint—the one that doesn't enforce one particular coding
style on its users—but then transformed into a separate static analysis
tool with its own goals and ideals.

Paste your code in the text area and click Lint.
