### Welcome to the JSHint Next preview.

**JSHint** was started over a year ago as a fork of Douglas Crockford's JSLint.
Since then the project has transformed into a separate static analysis tool
with its own goals and ideals.

**JSHint Next** is the next major iteration of the tool, where we've decided to
break away from the past, replacing JSLint's parser with Esprima and rethinking
JSHint's architecture.

This page contains the latest weekly release of JSHint&mdash;try it out and let us
know what you think! You can share your feedback by either sending an email to
[our mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/jshint/) or filing
[a bug report](/bug/).

Please note that since this is an early preview, some things are not finished
yet. For example, the reports are on the sparse side, but we plan to add more
information to them soon. And if you're looking for the current stable version
of JSHint, go to [jshint.com](http://www.jshint.com/).
